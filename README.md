# Beach Sustainability Information App ðŸŒŠ

## Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024** under the theme **Travel & Tourism** for the Ministry of Earth Science.

The app concept focuses on assessing the safety and suitability of coastal tourism sites in India using **real-time INCOIS API data**, including:
- Ocean alerts (wave height, currents, storm surges)
- Meteorological parameters (winds, temperature)
- Water quality

It provides a **suitability score** for each beach with **color-coded safety indicators**, geospatial mapping, and real-time alerts, helping tourists make safe and informed decisions.
